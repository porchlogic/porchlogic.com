## Join a swarm
- select `RX` (receive mode)
- if there is another SMB1 close by emitting a blue pulse, you can:
- 
-  join its swarm by scanning a qr code if they have it displayed
-  or
-  take your chances and join the first public transmission the board hears



## connect your instrument
- 📱 phone / tablet
- 🎛 synth/sampler (as USB MIDI *device*)

### 🔉 connect your speaker 
- (preferably a aux-input or low-latency bluetooth connection)



## Lead a swarm
- select `TX` (transmit mode)

## The Swarm

One unit becomes the **transmitter (`TX`)**, pulsing out tempo, position, and start/stop commands via MIDI clock.  

All other units become **receivers (`RX`)**, syncing wirelessly in real-time.

### The Format
Before the ride, participants agree on a shared structure. Simple. Modular. Syncable.

| Section | Length | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Intro  | 8 bars | Fade in, ambient pads |
| Drop   | 16 bars | Kick in, sync bass |
| Bridge | 8 bars | Modulate |
| Loop   | 32 bars | Repeat & evolve |

Everyone brings their own gear: synths, smartphones, samplers, speakers—and plugs into the swarm.
