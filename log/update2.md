# Update: Nov 1, 2024

I've been working on this cyberpack for a couple years now. It's meant to be a mobile audio-visual boom box that coordinates an orchestra of cyborgs roaming the streets on electric unicycles (EUCs) and other personal electric vehicles (PEVs).

I originally wanted to simply build a protective case for my speaker on my backpack when I started riding with the PDX Friday Night Ride, but it quickly escalated to a mobile computer system, with an MS Surface showing visuals synced with music, and a processor + camera arm for live-streaming the ride (this being a temporary measure until I have a drone that follows us around as a camera-bot).

Now in V2, I've focused more on audio synthesis componentsâ€”with a Dirtywave M8 as an audio engine, along with the Lenovo Legion Go as the visual engine.

The M8 is a tracker, which is like a Gameboy for composing music. There is a strong community around the M8 making beats that slap, and I want the cyberpack to be like a mobile venue/radio that M8 DJs can hook into and perform live, for both virtual stream and IRL audiences. Because the M8 is like a little Digital Audio Workstation, it can play music in sync (using MIDI) with other hardware, which means the DJ in my cyberpack can conduct an orchestra of connected cyborgs in the group ride.

Also, because the audios/visuals are performed live, the cyborg riders on the ground can integrate and influence the music with their movements and other controls. For example, my cyberpack connects to my EUC to get a live speed reading, which along with accelerometer/gyroscope data, affects the music in different ways.

I'm going to Hackaday Supercon this weekend, where I hope to connect with other cyborgs, and maybe dive deeper into the lower levels of circuitry.
