# Update: Nov 20, 2024

I'm going against my inclination to build everything from scratch and starting a Discord server.  
(I really want to build a custom UI for decentralized communication with protocols like Nostr, Lemmy, Mastadon, Bluesky, etc., but that's for later).  
I think Discord is the best option right now for coordinating group rides/performances, and working on other projects with people.  
Too much of my mind energy over the years has gone into ideas that never see the light of day, because I don't end up sparking any collaboration with them.

In my most creative moments, I start imagining building things with people I know who specialize in this or that,  
and I want a low-friction place to loop those people in on the initial sparks.

So, I'm going to try creating a new channel for each of these projects, and inviting those people to participate at will.  
I guess that's asynchronous work.

Anyway, if you'd like to join the server, come say hi and ask me what the current project is:
