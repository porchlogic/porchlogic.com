To make this appealing to music artists, I'm putting together a lineup of riders and their gear:

---

> **Layout / Components:**
>
> * Container with 6 cards representing band members
> * Each card styled like an NFT trading card with subtle animated neon border
> * Card contents:
>
>   * Member name (large, futuristic font)
>   * Gear used (smaller text)
>   * Possibly a small avatar or stylized icon
> * Cards arranged in a responsive grid that wraps on smaller screens

---

If you'd like to join, please let me know, and I'll add your card to the lineup

The initial music community I am connected to revolves around the Dirtywave M8 Tracker.
Samples of the music being made can be found various places like:

Reinterpret this sketch in a cyberpunk art style while preserving the same perspective and overall composition. Keep the pose, proportions, and layout consistent with the reference image. Make the background transparent. Style the subject in cyberpunk, watercolor, Studio Ghibli, video game. Outfit the subject with high-tech audio gear.
