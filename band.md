I'm working on a wireless music syncing system
So that a DJ can pipe-in and play our speakers live as we ride
with different parts of the song on different speakers, all synchronized

To make this appealing to music artists,
I want to put together a lineup of cyborg band members:

> div of cards representing 6 members
> each card should look similar to a NFT-style trading card
> each card should have a section for name, and gear used
